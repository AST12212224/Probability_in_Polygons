# Quantifying the Probability Distribution of a 0-Dimensional Polytope

## Overview
This repository contains the code to calculate probability values in my research paper **"Quantifying the probability distribution of a 0-dimensional polytope (point) relative to the centroid and boundary within various 2-dimensional regular polytopes (polygons), and analyzing the outcomes."**

The paper introduces a **Periodic Cotangent Function** to determine the probability of a Zero Polytope Monon (point in zero dimensions) being located near the center or boundary of a 2D regular polygon. The function exhibits periodic cycles between -2 and 2, resembling a logarithmic curve, providing novel insights into spatial probability distributions.

## Key Contributions
- **Mathematical Model**: A new function that determines the probability of a point's position in a polygon.
- **Periodic Cotangent Function**: Demonstrates periodic behavior in spatial probability.
- **Redefining cot(0)**: Proposes an alternative interpretation, suggesting that \( \cot 0 = \frac{90}{\pi \epsilon} \), instead of being undefined.
- **Implications**: Provides insights applicable to both theoretical and applied mathematics.
